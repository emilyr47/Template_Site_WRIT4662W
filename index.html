<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hi my name is Emily Raper, and I am a senior at the University of Minnesota.  I enjoy writing and technology both separtely and together and find myself taking on hobbies that incorporate both.  </p>
<p>Right now, I am working a a devloper for the math department in Vincent Hall.  We are progamming a new math learning interface that will hopefully be used to change the way math is taught for those with different learning styles and abilities.  I also work for Lutheran Social Services in St. Paul as a Web Communication Intern.  This position involves less programming and more writing, designing, and marketing work, as well as some web intercommunication work. </p>

<h2>Plans After Graduation</h2>

<p>My ideal job after graduation would be frontend developer on a web team or marketing and communications team.  This is the type of position I find myself most comfortable in and I know that it would be a great entrance into the industry, as I could incorporate both writing and coding while also being hired in an area of my strengths.  Working with other developers on a team will also give me an opportunity to observe and learn from those that are more experienced than I.</p>

<p>Eventually, as I get more real world experience, I would love to tackle more difficult programming projects for both frontend and backend code.  I would someday hope to move into a software developer job of some kind, but I plan on this taking some time.</p>
